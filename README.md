## What new in 2.0.0?

-   Split task
-   Auto import sass file when create a new component
-   Auto delete page in build floder
-   Optimize js using webpack

## Overview

gulp-boilerplate is an opinionated boilerplate for web development. Tools for building a great experience across many devices. A solid starting point for both professionals and newcomers to the industry.

## Browser Support

At present, i officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:

-   Chrome
-   Edge
-   Firefox
-   Safari
-   Internet Explorer

This is not to say that gulp-boilerplate cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that my focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.

## Prerequisites

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Bring up a terminal and type `node --version`.
Node should respond with a version at or above 4.0.x.
If you need to install Node, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

### [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

Bring up a terminal and type `gulp --version`.
If Gulp is installed it should return a version number at or above 3.9.x.
If you need to install/upgrade Gulp, open up a terminal and type in the following:

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

_This will install Gulp globally. Depending on your user account, you may need to [configure your system](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md) to install packages globally without administrative privileges._

**In this project i use Gulp version 4.0**

### Local dependencies

Next, install the local dependencies gulp-boilerplate requires:

```sh
$ npm install
```

or

```sh
$ npm i
```

That's it! You should now have everything needed to use the gulp-boilerplate.

You may also want to get used to some of the [commands](#commands) available.

## Commands

There are many commands available to help you build and test sites. Here are a few highlights to get started with.

### Watch For Changes & Automatically Refresh Across Devices

## Build & Optimize

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment.
This includes linting as well as image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.
Also, a [browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
script will be automatically generated, which will take care of precaching your sites' resources.

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Serve the Fully Built & Optimized Site

```sh
$ npm build
```

`npm build` task creates the `production/` folder in the root of the project with **dist files only**. It will **help you** to **create clear** instances of code for the **production** or **further implementation**.
